# Build a custom pega-web-ready Docker image using your preferred OS and JDK

Prerequisites:
• You have a basic knowledge of Docker and Linux commands.
• You have a base Docker image with your preferred OS and JDK.
• The base image you selected must have $CATALINA_HOME set to the correct tomcat location.

Pega provides a pega-web-ready Docker image using Tomcat 9 and JDK 11 as a base image. For more information about the pega-web-ready Docker image, see `pegasystems/docker-pega-web-ready`
To build a custom pega-web-ready image using your preferred OS and JDK, perform the following actions:

1. Create a Dockerfile for your custom pega-web-ready image using your base image and the open-source pega-web-ready Dockerfile code. 
   For more information, see pegasystems/docker-pega-web-ready/Dockerfile.
   Note: You can add any extra environment variables needed in the Dockerfile as per your use-case.

2. Use the following command to build the custom pega-web-ready image using the base image as an argument.
     ```bash
        docker build --build-arg BASE_TOMCAT_IMAGE=<BASE_IMAGE> -t <IMAGE_NAME> .
     ```
     
The system then builds your custom pega-web-ready Docker image.
